This is just a simple bare bones CMS for removing and pushing up Projects to my Portfolio site via a simple app in Flutter. My site has a Javascript method that fetches the file the CMS creates.

The file created is just a JSON file that is an array of JSON objects that have an Id, Title and Body properties.

Main View:
